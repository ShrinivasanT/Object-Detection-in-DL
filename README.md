# CIFAR-10 Image Classification

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates image classification on the **CIFAR-10 dataset** using **Deep Learning (Convolutional Neural Networks)**.  
The project covers **data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and visualization of results**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Loads and preprocesses the CIFAR-10 dataset
- Implements CNN architectures for image classification
- Trains the models and evaluates performance
- Visualizes training history and test results
- Compares accuracy across models

---

## 📊 Dataset
- **CIFAR-10** is a benchmark dataset consisting of:
  - 60,000 color images (32x32 pixels)
  - 10 different classes (airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck)
